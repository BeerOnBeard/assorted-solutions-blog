# The Site
The site is built on top of ![Hexo](https://hexo.io). I created a custom theme, so-fresh. The theme does not comply with the current standards for a stand-alone Hexo theme, but it works for this site. It's a very basic blog platform for me to write on.

# The System as a Whole
The master branch holds the code for the site. The deploy branch holds the generated static site. TravisCI is used to build the site and push it to the deploy branch every time a commit is made to master.
